#### Core Fields
Great when content is simple and well organised in categories, but gets more complex with multiple content types and layouts (e.g. news/events/blog).

- content type(CCK)
- article state
- featured
- article category.

#### Custom Fields
Adding your own filters can make life a little easier when content very similar and creating additional content types makes no sense.

- article type
- list layout
- list style
