# Lists

Essentially lists are the results of a search to which specific filters are applied to get desired results.

Results can then be displayed with the following options:

- layout
- style

###Layout

Although there might only be a few recognised options here, having the flexibilty to implement them on the fly can save time. Bear in mind that the Joomla! core category  blog layout needs to be considered in case someone finds the link. Joomla! category links are essential for SEF Url link building.

Each list will have it's own search form and item template which can be useful.

List items can be displayed using a combination of the list style and list layout filters. Effectively used layout files can be created and included based on these selections.
