# Lists

Essentially lists are the results of a search to which specific filters are applied to get desired results.

Results can then be displayed with the following options:

- layout
- style

###Layout

Although there might only be a few recognised options here, having the flexibilty to implement them on the fly can save time. Bear in mind that the Joomla! core category  blog layout need to be considered in case someone finds the link. Joomla! category links are essential for SEF Url link building.
