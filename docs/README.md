# W3 Template CSS/JS Roadmap

This framework is intended to be used as an istallable custom Joomla! template. The template only deals with styling and UI and relies on the W3 Framework for layout and structure.

File structure and naming conventions have been emulated as far as possible and there may be further dependancies to harness the full potential of the W3 framework.

W3 is structured around natural language conventions to make development more intuitive.

W3 is tag agnostic meaning you can use any html tags with UI elements.

W3 elements are intended to cascade and the aim is to avoid repetition by creating additional code using specificity.

Specaial thanks to some of the existing frameworks out there for guidance and inspiration.
